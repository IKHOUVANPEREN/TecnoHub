# TecnoHub
TecnoHub was a script hub that I worked on for about 4-5 months, I discontinued it shortly after losing interest in Roblox Exploiting, published it here for learning purposes

# Note
This is not going to work btw, lots of links are gone by now

# What Can Be Learned From This?


- Simple Whitelist System;

- Simple Scripting and a bit more advanced scripting;

- Game Detection;

<code>
  
-- Here's the simple game detection script

place = game.PlaceId

if place == 0 then -- Example number put the game id in there

elseif place == 1 then -- You can keep repeating this until you have all your game id's in there, of course with your desired game id and not repeating the same id

else

print("Game not detected, please check featured games in the discord")

end

</code>

Enjoy!
